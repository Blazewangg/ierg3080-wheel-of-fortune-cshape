#IERG3080 Project I - Topic 2: Wheel of Fortune
## Project Specifications
Implement a Wheel of Fortune game. In the game, there are:
1. A Canvas that shows the Wheel of Fortune.
2. A Button that rotates the Wheel and another Button that stops the Wheel.
3. A TextBlock that shows the amount of money you currently have.
The Wheel should have at least 4 distinct colors, each represents the amount of money you
earn/lose in this spin.
a. Red: $1000
b. Blue: $100
c. Green: $10
d. Grey: -$500
e. You can add additional colors
The text on the Wheel is optional, but you need to describe the mapping of the colors and
the amounts in text in the UI. The player starts with $1000. If the player loses all the money,
then the UI
1. Prompts “Game Over”
2. Prevents the player to further spin the Wheel
3. Provides a Button to restart the game
